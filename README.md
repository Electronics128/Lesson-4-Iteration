# Lesson 4: Iteration

This lesson focuses on Python loops, which allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. By completing these exercises, you'll master `for` and `while` loops, nested loops, and important control flow mechanisms like `break` and `continue`.

---

## Lesson Objectives
- Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate over sequences.
- Apply control flow statements (`break`, `continue`) to manage loop behavior.
- Write nested loops to solve multi-dimensional problems.
- Use Python's range and enumerate functions for indexed iteration.
- Debug and refine loop-based logic.

---

## Exercises
In this lesson, you will work through 10 TODOs to strengthen your understanding of iteration:
1. Write a basic `for` loop to iterate through a list.
2. Use `enumerate` to iterate through a sequence with indices.
3. Work with the `range` function for numerical iteration.
4. Create nested loops to generate a multiplication table.
5. Use a `while` loop to count down numbers.
6. Implement `break` to exit a loop early.
7. Implement `continue` to skip specific iterations.
8. Write and stop an infinite loop using a `while True` statement.
9. Iterate over dictionaries to extract keys and values.
10. Debug and fix a faulty loop.

## Practical Examples
Here are additional real-world examples to further enhance your skills with iteration:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
   - Write a program to generate the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.  
   - Use a loop to calculate each number based on the previous two numbers.

2. **Factorial Calculation**  
   - Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.  
   - Ask the user for a number and use a loop to compute the factorial.

3. **Simulating a Dice Roll**  
   - Write a program to simulate rolling a dice 10 times.  
   - Count and print the occurrences of each number (1â€“6).

4. **Modeling Savings Growth**  
   - Write a program to model the growth of savings over time.  
   - Start with an initial amount and add monthly deposits.  
   - Apply a 2% annual interest rate (compounded monthly) and print the balance for each month.

5. **Pattern Printing**  
   - Write a program to print a pyramid pattern of stars.  
   Example for 4 rows:  
   *
  ***
 *****
*******

6. **Prime Number Checker**  
- Write a program to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.  
- Use nested loops to check divisibility.

7. **Simulating a Queue**  
- Write a program to simulate a customer queue using a list.  
- Add new customers to the queue and serve them (remove from the front).  
- Print the queue after each operation.
