# Lesson 4: Iteration

This lesson focuses on using loops for iteration in Python. Youâ€™ll learn how to use `for` loops, `while` loops, and nested loops, as well as control flow with `break` and `continue`.

## Objectives:
- Understand how to iterate over sequences and ranges.
- Use `while` loops for indefinite iteration.
- Apply control flow statements like `break` and `continue`.
- Debug loop-related logic errors.

## TODOs:
1. Write a basic `for` loop to iterate through a list.
2. Use `enumerate` to iterate with indices.
3. Work with the `range` function for numerical iteration.
4. Create nested loops to generate a multiplication table.
5. Use a `while` loop to count down numbers.
6. Implement `break` to exit a loop.
7. Implement `continue` to skip loop iterations.
8. Write and stop an infinite loop.
9. Iterate over dictionaries to extract keys and values.
10. Debug and fix a faulty loop.

## How to Complete the Lesson:
1. Open `lesson_04.py` and complete the TODOs.
2. Run the script to test your loops.

## How to Test Your Code:
Run the test script to verify your solutions:

```bash
python3 test_lesson_04.py
