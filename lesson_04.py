# Lesson 4: Iteration

# TODO 1: Basic `for` loop:
# - Create a list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
# - Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and print each number.

# TODO 2: Iterating with indices:
# - Use `enumerate` to iterate through `numbers` and print the index and value.

# TODO 3: Iterating over a range:
# - Use `range` to print numbers from 1 to 10.

# TODO 4: Nested loops:
# - Create a nested loop to print a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 3.

# TODO 5: While loop basics:
# - Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 5 to 1.

# TODO 6: Break in loops:
# - Use a loop to iterate through `numbers` and break when the number 3 is encountered.

# TODO 7: Continue in loops:
# - Use a loop to skip printing the number 3 in `numbers`.

# TODO 8: Infinite loop:
# - Write a `while True` loop that prints "Hello" 5 times, then stops using a break condition.

# TODO 9: Iterating over dictionaries:
# - Create a dictionary `person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`.
# - Iterate over the dictionary to print keys and values.

# TODO 10: Debugging loops:
# - Write a loop with a logic error.
# - Use print statements to debug and fix the issue.
